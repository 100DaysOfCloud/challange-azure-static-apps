## Considerations

Gitpod uses the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/)
The extension we need is in Microsoft's proprietary marketplace which is the default Marketplace for Vscode.
If you are using Gitpod you can get around this issue by simply launching Gitpod in your Local VSCode since
that will be using Microsoft's proprietary marketplace.
