## Considerations

We need to install the `Azure Static Web Apps` VSCode Extension which can only be installed on a local VSCode.
Gitpod is unable to install certain VSCode Extensions since they use a Open VSCode Marketplace.
So you need to use the Gitpod remote feature to utilize Gitpod as well as the VSCode Extensions we need.
